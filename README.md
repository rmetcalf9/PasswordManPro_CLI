# Password Manager PRO - Commandline interface

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rmetcalf9/PasswordManPro_CLI.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rmetcalf9/PasswordManPro_CLI)
[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/passwordmanpro_cli.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/passwordmanpro_cli)

Python based command line interface for [Password Manager Pro](https://www.manageengine.com/products/passwordmanagerpro/help/restapi.html). This provides a command line interface which uses the REST API to provide a command line to:

 - Read individual passwords
 - Create temporary files with a set of passwords


# Setup

Python and pip must be installed on the machine you wish to use.

 1. Create a API user in [Password Manager Pro](https://www.manageengine.com/products/passwordmanagerpro/help/restapi.html)
 2. Set the PASSMANCLI_AUTHTOKEN enviroment variable based on the user (Alternativly set PASSMANCLI_AUTHTOKENFILE if you wish to load the key from a file)
 3. Set the PASSMANCLI_URL enviroment variable based on your install of password manager pro
 4. Install utility:
```
pip3 install PasswordManPro_CLI
```
 
# Usage

## Access single password

```
passwordmanpro_cli get "**RESOURSE_NAME**" "**PASSWORD_NAME**"
```

## Generate java properties style password file

e.g.:<br>
**resoursename**.username = someuser<br>
**resoursename**.password = somepassword


Only resourses with a single account are output - see [Limitations of Password manager API](### Limitations of Password manager API)

This file can be created with the following command:
```
passwordmanpro_cli javaprops **FILTER** > somefile.properties
```

## Directly access the API

The previous functions were created for convience because the API uses resourse ID and password ID rather than the names. To provide further flexibility the rawget command is provided which allows users to call apis. (The auth token is added invisibly based on enviroment paramaters)

```
passwordmanpro_cli rawget **URL**
```

Exmaple:
```
passwordmanpro_cli rawget /restapi/json/v1/resources
```



## Notes

### Limitations of Password manager API
In password manager a resourse can have mutiple accounts. Each account has a username and a password, unfortunatly accounts do not have another name associated with them. This makes it impossible to refer to which account will be needed. 
 - I have experimented with using the notes field but this is not returned in API calls
 - I have experimented with using custom fields but these also were not returned in API calls
As a workaround only resourses with a single acocunt are output in the generated file and the resourse name is used as an identifier.

This means to use this files you must create your resourses so that each only has one account.

### Using on a windows Box

On windows it is possible to set the output to an enviroment varaible.
 - you must > nul otherwise passwords will appear in Jenkins logs

This means the UiLauncher can recieve passwords as JSON arguments:

````
FOR /F "tokens=*" %g IN ('passwordmanpro_cli jsonpropssingleline BANNER') do (SET PASSVAR=%g) > nul

UiLauncher.exe /file:"workflow.xaml" /input:"%PASSVAR%"
````
